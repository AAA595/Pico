= Pico

image::{root}/preview.jpg[align="center"]

This project is still _work in progress_ and is not fully documented yet (but most `/help <command>` messages are pretty self-explanatory). Pico aims to support most building features found on server softwares such as MCGalaxy or LegendCraft. This includes:

* Undoing
* Copy/pasting
* Repeating commands
* Brushes
* All basic drawing commands: `/Fill`, `/Outline`, `/Tree`, etc.
* Many convenient commands: `/Ascend`, `/ReachDistance`, `/Mark`, etc.

== Download

link:https://github.com/dflat2/Pico/releases/tag/0.2.0[Download Pico from here]

== Installing

To install the plugin, move `pico.dylib` (or `.dll` or `.so`) in the `ClassiCube/plugins` directory.

== Compiling

Before compiling, clone the repository. The `--recurse-submodules` option will also clone the `ClassiCube` submodule (required for resolving header files).

[source,bash]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dflat2/pico.git
cd pico
----

=== Linux

You must have a C compiler installed (for example link:https://gcc.gnu.org/install/[gcc], which can be installed with `apt install build-essential` on Ubuntu). Then, run this command from the root directory of the repository:

[source,bash]
----
gcc `find src/ -name '*.c'` -I. -I./src -o pico.so -shared -fPIC
----

You may need to add `-lm` after `find src/ -name`, as some object files require `<math.h>`.

=== Mac

Run this command from the root directory of the repository.

[source,bash]
----
gcc `find src/ -name '*.c'` -I. -I./src -o pico.dylib -shared -undefined dynamic_lookup
----

*Note.* If your Mac supports `arm` _and_ if you downloaded ClassiCube from https://classicube.net, you will probably need to append `-arch x86_64` (otherwise it will compile for `arm` and not work as the client is on `x86_64`).

=== Windows

I did not test compiling on Windows yet. But you may follow the instructions documented in the ClassiCube repository: link:https://github.com/UnknownShadow200/ClassiCube/blob/master/doc/plugin-dev.md#using-mingw-w64[Using mingw-w64]. Then for the _compiling_ part:

[source,bash]
----
gcc `find src/ -name '*.c'` -I. -I./src -o pico.dll -shared -L . -lClassiCube
----
